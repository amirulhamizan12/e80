## Access and Use of the Service

### Service Description

The Service is designed to offer users robust browser automation capabilities by leveraging artificial intelligence for the purpose of executing DOM actions and fulfilling natural language commands on websites. The Service utilizes advanced AI models to interpret user intentions and perform automated interactions with web pages, including but not limited to clicking elements, filling forms, navigating websites, and extracting information. The Service integrates with multiple third-party AI model providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and others to deliver sophisticated natural language processing and decision-making capabilities.

### Your Registration Obligations

You may be required to register with Superwizard AI or provide information about yourself (such as name, email address, and payment information) in order to access and use certain features of the Service. If you choose to register for the Service, you agree to provide and maintain true, accurate, current, and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Service's registration form. Registration data and certain other information about you are governed by our Privacy Policy. If you are under 13 years of age, you are not authorized to use the Service, with or without registering. In addition, if you are under 18 years old, you may use the Service, with or without registering, only with the express consent of your parent or guardian, and such parent or guardian must provide true, accurate, current, and complete information as requested by Superwizard AI to confirm such express consent. To the extent you are entering into these Terms of Service on behalf of a company, business or other legal entity, you are responsible for obtaining and maintaining all required consents from your end users to allow Superwizard AI to provide the Service to you and your end users.

### Member Account, Password and Security

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account details, if any, and are fully responsible for any and all activities that occur under your password or account. You agree to immediately notify Superwizard AI of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security, and ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session when accessing the Service. You acknowledge that the Service operates as a browser extension with elevated permissions to interact with websites, and you are solely responsible for ensuring that your account credentials are kept secure to prevent unauthorized automation activities. Superwizard AI and its current and future affiliates (collectively, "Superwizard Affiliates") will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this paragraph.

### Modifications to Service

Superwizard AI reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part thereof) with or without notice. This includes but is not limited to changes in AI model providers, automation capabilities, supported websites, pricing structures, or feature availability. You agree that Superwizard AI and Superwizard Affiliates will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Service. We may establish general practices and limits concerning use of the Service, including without limitation the maximum number of automation tasks that may be executed per day, the maximum period of time that data or other content will be retained by the Service, the maximum storage space that will be allotted on Superwizard AI's or its third-party service providers' servers on your behalf, and the maximum frequency with which you may access the Service. You agree that Superwizard AI has no responsibility or liability for the deletion or failure to store any data or other content maintained or uploaded by the Service. You acknowledge that Superwizard AI reserves the right to terminate accounts that are inactive for an extended period of time or that engage in activities that may be deemed abusive or harmful to the Service or other users.

## Conditions of Access and Use

### User Conduct

You are solely responsible for all automation commands, scripts, data, content, and instructions ("User Content") that you provide to or execute through the Service. The following are examples of the kinds of content and uses that are illegal or prohibited by Superwizard AI. Superwizard AI reserves the right to investigate and take appropriate legal action against anyone who, in Superwizard AI's sole discretion, violates this provision, including terminating the Service to such violators, suspending or terminating the account of such violators, and reporting the violator to law enforcement authorities. You agree to not use the Service to violate any applicable local, state, national, or international law, rule, or regulation; infringe on the intellectual property rights of others; engage in unauthorized access to computer systems, networks, or data; perform actions that violate the terms of service of websites you interact with through the Service; scrape, harvest, or collect data from websites without proper authorization or in violation of applicable laws; distribute malware, viruses, or other harmful code; engage in fraudulent, deceptive, or misleading practices; attempt to bypass security measures, access controls, or rate limiting mechanisms; interfere with or disrupt the Service's operation, servers, or networks; use the Service to send spam, unsolicited communications, or engage in other unwanted contact; impersonate any person or entity or falsely state or otherwise misrepresent your affiliation with a person or entity; attempt to gain unauthorized access to other users' accounts or personal information; use the Service for any unlawful purpose or to solicit others to perform unlawful acts; or use automated means to access websites in a manner that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair any website or interfere with any other party's use and enjoyment of any website.

You acknowledge that the Service provides powerful automation capabilities that can execute actions on websites at scale, and you agree to use such capabilities responsibly and in compliance with all applicable laws and website terms of service. You further acknowledge that many websites have terms of service that prohibit automated access or require explicit permission for automated interactions, and you are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with such terms before using the Service to interact with any website. If you are blocked by Superwizard AI from accessing the Service (including by blocking your IP address or account), you agree not to implement any measures to circumvent such blocking (e.g., by creating new accounts, masking your IP address, or using proxy servers or virtual private networks to evade restrictions).

### Competitors

No employee, independent contractor, agent, or affiliate of any company that offers browser automation, AI-powered web interaction, or competitive services to the Service is permitted to view, access, or use any portion of the Service without express written permission from Superwizard AI. By viewing, using, or accessing the Service, you represent and warrant that you are not a competitor of Superwizard AI or any Superwizard Affiliate, or acting on behalf of a competitor of Superwizard AI or any Superwizard Affiliate in using or accessing the Service.

### Fees and Payment

To the extent the Service or any portion thereof is made available for any fee, you may be required to select a payment plan and provide information regarding your credit card or other payment instrument. You represent and warrant to Superwizard AI that such information is true and that you are authorized to use the payment instrument. You will promptly update your account information with any changes (for example, a change in your billing address or credit card expiration date) that may occur. You agree to pay Superwizard AI the amount that is specified in the payment plan in accordance with the terms of such plan and these Terms of Service. Fees may be based on various factors including but not limited to the number of automation tasks executed, AI model usage and token consumption, premium feature access, or subscription tier selected. If your payment plan includes an ongoing subscription that is automatically renewed periodically, you hereby authorize Superwizard AI to bill your payment instrument in advance on such periodic basis in accordance with the terms of the applicable payment plan until you terminate your account, and you further agree to pay any charges so incurred. If you dispute any charges, you must notify Superwizard AI within sixty (60) days after the date that Superwizard AI charges you. We reserve the right to change Superwizard AI's prices at any time. If Superwizard AI changes prices, we will provide notice of the change through the Service user interface, browser extension notification, email, or through other reasonable means, at least thirty (30) days before the change is to take effect. Your continued use of the Service after the price change becomes effective constitutes your agreement to pay the changed amount. You will be responsible for all taxes associated with the Service, other than taxes based on Superwizard AI's net income.

### Payment Processing

Notwithstanding any amounts owed to Superwizard AI hereunder, SUPERWIZARD AI DOES NOT DIRECTLY PROCESS PAYMENTS FOR THE SERVICE. To facilitate payment for the Service via bank account, credit card, or debit card, we use third-party payment processors including Stripe, Inc. and its affiliates ("Payment Processors"). These payment processing services are provided by the Payment Processors and are subject to their respective terms and conditions, privacy policies, and other agreements. By agreeing to these Terms of Service, users that use the payment functions of the Service also agree to be bound by the applicable Payment Processor agreements, as the same may be modified by such Payment Processors from time to time. You hereby authorize the applicable Payment Processor to store and continue billing your specified payment method even after such payment method has expired, to avoid interruptions in payment for your use of the Service. Superwizard AI assumes no liability or responsibility for any payments you make through the Service or any issues related to payment processing.

### Refunds and Cancellations

Payments made by you hereunder are generally final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by Superwizard AI in its sole discretion or required by applicable law. You may cancel your subscription at any time by accessing your account settings or by contacting us at support@superwizard.ai. Upon cancellation, you will continue to have access to paid features through the end of your current billing period, after which your account will revert to the free tier (if available) or be terminated. We reserve the right to provide refunds on a case-by-case basis for exceptional circumstances, including but not limited to technical issues that prevent Service usage or significant changes to Service functionality.

## Disclaimer of Warranties

YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. THE SUPERWIZARD PARTIES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE OR WITH THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO DISCONTINUE USE OF THE SERVICE AND UNINSTALL THE BROWSER EXTENSION.

## Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration

**PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.**

This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is referred to in these Terms of Service as the "Arbitration Agreement." You agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and Superwizard AI, whether arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service (including any alleged breach thereof), the Service, any advertising, any automated actions performed through the Service, any billing or payment issues, or any aspect of the relationship or transactions between us, will be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify. Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into these Terms of Service, you and Superwizard AI are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.

YOU AND SUPERWIZARD AI AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND SUPERWIZARD AI AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S).

Superwizard AI is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer's satisfaction by emailing customer support at support@superwizard.ai. If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice"). The Notice to Superwizard AI should be sent to support@superwizard.ai ("Notice Address"). The Notice must describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and set forth the specific relief sought. If Superwizard AI and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Superwizard AI may commence an arbitration proceeding.

Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association's ("AAA") rules and procedures, including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, the "AAA Rules"), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information on the AAA, please visit its website, https://www.adr.org. If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms of Service as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement.

Unless Superwizard AI and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination will be made by AAA. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement. To the extent any such fees are not specifically allocated to either Superwizard AI or you under the AAA Rules, Superwizard AI and you will split them equally; provided that if you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of such fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of any fees, Superwizard AI will pay your portion of such fees.

## Termination

You agree that Superwizard AI, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate your account (or any part thereof) or use of the Service and remove and discard any content within the Service, for any reason, including without limitation for lack of use, violation of these Terms of Service, engaging in prohibited activities, failure to pay applicable fees, or if Superwizard AI believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these Terms of Service. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive, or illegal activity that may be grounds for termination of your use of the Service, may be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities. Superwizard AI may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing the Service, or any part thereof, with or without notice. You agree that any termination of your access to the Service under any provision of these Terms of Service may be effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that Superwizard AI may immediately deactivate or delete your account and all related information and files in your account and bar any further access to such files or the Service. Further, you agree that Superwizard AI and Superwizard Affiliates will not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your access to the Service.

## General

These Terms of Service (together with the terms incorporated by reference herein, including our Privacy Policy) constitute the entire agreement between you and Superwizard AI governing your access and use of the Service, and supersede any prior agreements between you and Superwizard AI with respect to the Service. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use Third-Party Services, third-party content, or third-party software. These Terms of Service will be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its conflict of law provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth above, you and Superwizard AI submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within New Castle County, Delaware. The failure of Superwizard AI to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of Service remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or these Terms of Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. A printed version of these Terms of Service and of any notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to these Terms of Service to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.

You may not assign these Terms of Service or any of your rights or obligations under these Terms of Service without the prior written consent of Superwizard AI, but Superwizard AI may assign or transfer these Terms of Service, in whole or in part, without restriction. The section titles in these Terms of Service are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. As used in these Terms of Service, the words "include" and "including," and variations thereof, will not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather will be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." Notices to you may be made via email, browser extension notifications, or regular mail. The Service may also provide notices to you of changes to these Terms of Service or other matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally on the Service or within the browser extension interface. Superwizard AI will not be in default hereunder by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations where such failure or delay is due to civil disturbances, riot, epidemic, hostilities, war, terrorist attack, embargo, natural disaster, acts of God, flood, fire, sabotage, fluctuations or unavailability of electrical power, network access or equipment, third-party AI model provider outages or limitations, or any other circumstances or causes beyond Superwizard AI's reasonable control.

## Data Security and AI Processing

You acknowledge that the Service necessarily processes website content, user inputs, and other data through artificial intelligence systems, including third-party AI model providers, to deliver automation functionality. Such processing may involve transmitting screenshots, DOM content, user commands, and other information to AI providers' servers, which may be located in various jurisdictions. While we implement reasonable security measures to protect data in transmission and processing, you understand that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is one hundred percent secure. You acknowledge the inherent risks involved in AI processing and automated web interactions, and you assume all risks associated with the use of the Service for your specific use cases and data sensitivity requirements.

## Compliance and Legal Obligations

You represent and warrant that your use of the Service complies with all applicable laws, regulations, and third-party agreements in your jurisdiction and any jurisdiction where automated actions are performed. This includes but is not limited to data protection laws, computer fraud and abuse laws, intellectual property laws, and website terms of service. You acknowledge that automated web interactions may be subject to various legal restrictions, and you are solely responsible for ensuring that your use of the Service does not violate any applicable legal or contractual obligations.
