With your consent, we may send you marketing communications about new features, Service improvements, industry insights, or other information that we believe may be of interest to you. You can opt out of marketing communications at any time through your account settings or by following the unsubscribe instructions in our communications.

### Business Operations and Legal Compliance

We use your information for various business operations including billing and payment processing, fraud prevention, security monitoring, and compliance with legal obligations. This includes analyzing usage patterns to detect potential abuse, monitoring for security threats, and maintaining records as required by applicable laws and regulations.

We may use aggregated and anonymized data for business analytics, market research, and strategic planning to better understand how the Service is used and how we can improve our offerings. This information helps us make informed decisions about feature development, pricing, infrastructure investments, and business partnerships.

In some cases, we may use your information to enforce our Terms of Service, investigate violations, or protect the rights, property, or safety of Superwizard, our users, or others. This could include cooperating with law enforcement investigations or legal proceedings when required by law.

## Information Sharing and Disclosure

### Third-Party AI Model Providers

Due to the nature of our Service, we necessarily share website content, automation commands, and related data with third-party artificial intelligence model providers to deliver core functionality.

We work to ensure that our AI provider relationships include appropriate privacy safeguards, but you acknowledge that data shared with these providers is subject to their privacy practices and policies.

The specific data shared with AI providers typically includes website content from pages you interact with, screenshots when visual analysis is required, natural language commands and instructions you provide, and context information necessary for automation tasks. We implement technical and contractual measures to limit data sharing to what is necessary for Service functionality, but the nature of AI processing requires substantial data sharing to deliver effective automation capabilities.

### Service Providers and Business Partners

We share personal information with trusted third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf and help us operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market the Service. These service providers are contractually obligated to handle your information securely and only use it for the specific purposes for which we engage them.

Our primary service providers include Supabase, which provides authentication and user management services and has access to your account information and authentication data. We also work with cloud infrastructure providers, analytics services, customer support platforms, and monitoring services that may have access to certain categories of your information as necessary to provide their services to us.

Payment processing services handle billing and payment information on our behalf, though we do not directly collect or store complete payment card information. These providers are subject to strict security standards and regulatory requirements for handling financial information.

We may share aggregated, anonymized, or statistical information that does not identify you personally with business partners, investors, or other third parties for business development, research, or marketing purposes. This information cannot be used to identify individual users.

### Legal Requirements and Protection of Rights

We may access, preserve, and disclose your personal information if we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to comply with applicable laws, regulations, legal processes, or governmental requests. This includes responding to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal demands, though we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of such requests unless prohibited by law or we believe notification would compromise an investigation.

We may also disclose your information to protect the rights, property, or safety of Superwizard, our users, or the public. This includes investigating potential violations of our Terms of Service, preventing fraud or abuse, protecting against security threats, or addressing other harmful activities. We may share information with law enforcement agencies when we believe it is necessary to prevent serious harm or illegal activity.

In connection with any merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets, we may transfer your personal information as part of the business transaction. In such cases, we will provide notice before your personal information becomes subject to a different privacy policy and will ensure that appropriate privacy protections remain in place during the transition.

### Your Control Over Information Sharing

We have established comprehensive incident response procedures to address potential security breaches or privacy incidents. Our response procedures include immediate containment and assessment of incidents, investigation to determine the scope and cause of any breach, notification of affected users and relevant authorities as required by law, and remediation steps to prevent similar incidents in the future.

In the event of a data breach that poses a risk to your rights and freedoms, we will notify you promptly through email, Service notifications, or other appropriate means. We will provide clear information about what happened, what information was involved, what we are doing to address the incident, and what steps you can take to protect yourself.

We continuously monitor our systems for potential security threats and regularly update our security measures based on emerging threats and best practices. We also conduct regular security training for our personnel and periodic security assessments to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

## Data Retention and Deletion

### Retention Periods and Policies

We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to provide the Service, fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. The specific retention period depends on the type of information and the purposes for which we use it.

Account information is retained for as long as your account remains active and for a reasonable period thereafter to facilitate account reactivation and provide customer support. Usage data and automation history are typically retained for up to two years to provide Service analytics, improve functionality, and support your use of the Service, though you can request earlier deletion of specific data as described below.

Website content and screenshots processed through the Service are generally deleted shortly after processing is complete, typically within 24-48 hours, unless longer retention is necessary for debugging, customer support, or other legitimate business purposes. However, aggregated and anonymized data derived from this content may be retained longer for Service improvement purposes.

Technical logs and diagnostic information are typically retained for up to one year for troubleshooting and Service improvement purposes. Legal hold requirements, regulatory obligations, or ongoing disputes may require us to retain certain information for longer periods as required by applicable law.

### Data Deletion and Account Termination

However, the nature of browser automation requires certain data collection to function properly, and you should consider this when deciding whether to use the Service on websites containing sensitive information.

## Children's Privacy and Age Requirements

### Age Restrictions and Verification

The Service is not intended for use by children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete such information promptly. Parents and guardians who believe that their child under 13 has provided personal information to us should contact us immediately.

Users between the ages of 13 and 18 may use the Service only with the express consent and supervision of a parent or guardian. Such users and their parents or guardians are responsible for ensuring that the use of the Service complies with applicable laws and that appropriate privacy protections are in place for any automated web interactions.

We do not target the Service to children and do not create profiles specifically designed to appeal to children. Our marketing and advertising practices are directed toward adult users, and we do not knowingly engage in marketing activities directed toward children.

### Parental Controls and Family Safety

Parents and guardians who permit their children to use the Service should be aware that the Service can access and interact with any website that the user visits, which may include content that is not appropriate for children. We recommend that parents implement appropriate parental controls and supervision when children are using browser-based services.

The nature of our AI-powered automation Service means that sensitive or inappropriate content could potentially be processed through our systems if users interact with websites containing such content. Parents should carefully consider whether the Service is appropriate for their children and should supervise its use accordingly.
